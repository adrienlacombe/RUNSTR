# Profile Components Directory

User profile screen components and profile-related functionality.

## Architecture Overview

The profile section uses a **Public/All tab architecture** with enhanced workout management:

- **Public Tab** - Shows published Nostr kind 1301 workout events
- **All Tab** - Unified view merging HealthKit, Garmin, Google Fit, and Nostr workouts
- **Sync Dropdown** - Manual import control for various fitness data sources
- **Post/Compete Actions** - Buttons to share workouts socially or enter competitions
- **Monthly Organization** - Workouts grouped by month for better navigation

This architecture provides a clear distinction between public (shared) and private (local) workouts with seamless posting capabilities.
